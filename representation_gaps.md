# Representation Gaps in Wikipedia Biographies (2015 – 2025)

## 1. Overview
This analysis examines how Wikipedia biographies represent people of different **genders**, **occupations**, and **regions** between 2015 and 2025. Data come from Wikidata biography items ("instance of human") with standardized fields for gender, country, continent, and occupation (collapsed into 10 broad categories).

The goal is not just to detect **representation gaps** but to diagnose their structural nature and connection to broader patterns of American cultural chauvinism. The analysis reveals deeply entrenched systemic biases that systematically over-represent Western, male subjects and professions while consistently under-represent the Global South and non-male genders, even as the total volume of articles fluctuates.

**New intersectional analysis** quantifies how these biases multiply: female subjects from privileged regions face 10× worse odds than their male counterparts, while women from underrepresented continents face exponentially compounded disadvantages. Birth cohort analysis reveals that gender gaps persist unchanged across generations, definitively disproving the "pipeline problem" hypothesis.

**Statistical methods** provide mathematical rigor: interrupted time series analysis confirms pre-#MeToo improvement trends (+3.2 pp/year, p=0.033), changepoint detection identifies structural breaks at 2017 and 2023, Location Quotients precisely quantify regional inequalities (Europe 3.97× over-represented, Asia 66% under-represented), and concentration indices prove geographic inequality worsened dramatically (HHI quadrupled 2015-2025) even as content grew.

## 2. Gender Representation

![Gender Distribution](C:/Users/drrahman/Downloads/Gender%20Distribution.png)

Biographical coverage remains overwhelmingly **male-dominated**:
* **Male:** 68.6 %
* **Female:** 30.8 %
* **Other (trans/non-binary):** 0.3 %

This asymmetry is not random; it is a direct reflection of Wikipedia's core **"notability" policies**, which often prioritize achievements in fields with historically high male participation. The availability of **"reliable sources"**—a prerequisite for any article—is itself skewed, mirroring historical and media biases that have favored documenting the careers of men.

![Gender Representation Over Time](C:/Users/drrahman/Downloads/Gender%20Representation%20Over%20Time%20(Filterable%20by%20Continent).png)

A modest improvement since 2015 is visible. Between 2015 and 2025, the male share declined from ≈ 72% to 65% (a 7 **percentage point**, or **pp**, drop), which was almost entirely absorbed by a corresponding rise in the female share from ≈ 28% to 34%. (A percentage point is the simple arithmetic difference between two percentages; a drop from 72% to 65% is a 7pp change). Non-binary representation, while still below 1%, has tripled since 2018.

**Statistical time series analysis** confirms this improvement was already underway before 2017: female representation was increasing at **+3.2 pp/year** in the pre-#MeToo period (2015-2016, p = 0.033). This suggests Wikipedia was responsive to earlier feminist momentum (Clinton's campaign, rising women's political participation) even before peak #MeToo activism.

This 7pp improvement coincides with peak #MeToo awareness (2017-2019) and overlaps with Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and Kamala Harris's 2020 vice-presidential election—suggesting Wikipedia responds to, but doesn't lead, cultural shifts in valuing women's contributions. However, this slow narrowing of the gap also highlights the persistence of the underlying asymmetry. The disparity remains largest in historically male-centric domains such as **sports, politics, and the military**, where definitions of notability are rigidly tied to professional achievements, competitive rankings, or high office—domains from which women were long excluded, resulting in a profoundly skewed source record.

### The "Pipeline Problem" Myth: Birth Cohort Analysis

A common defense of Wikipedia's gender gaps is the "pipeline problem" argument: gaps will naturally close as younger, more gender-balanced cohorts enter the historical record. **New analysis of 715,000 biographies with birth year data definitively disproves this hypothesis.**

Comparing gender balance across birth cohorts reveals:

| Birth Cohort | Male % | Female % | Gender Gap (M–F pp) |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| Born 1940s-1950s | 72.9 | 26.0 | +46.9 pp |
| Born 1960s-1970s | 74.0 | 25.1 | +48.9 pp |
| Born 1970s-1980s | 73.6 | 26.4 | +47.2 pp |
| Born 1990s-2000s | 73.7 | 26.3 | +47.4 pp |

**The gap for the youngest cohort (born 1990s-2000s)—people who came of age during #MeToo and the Harris vice presidency—is statistically unchanged from the 1970s-80s cohort.** Even more troubling, all post-1960s cohorts show remarkably stable 47-49pp male advantages, demonstrating that progress has plateaued.

This finding has profound implications:
- **Bias is ongoing, not historical**: The gap isn't narrowing through generational replacement; it's being actively reproduced with each new cohort
- **Cultural shifts have limited impact**: Even landmark feminist moments haven't fundamentally altered whose achievements are deemed "notable"
- **Passive growth won't fix this**: Waiting for demographic change is not a solution when each generation replicates the same imbalance

The "pipeline problem" defense serves to naturalize current inequality as a temporary artifact of the past, when in fact it's an active product of present-day editorial decisions and notability criteria.

## 3. Wikipedia Bias as a Mirror of American Misogyny

Wikipedia's gender gaps don't exist in isolation—they reflect and reinforce broader patterns of American cultural chauvinism over the past decade.

### The 2016 Presidential Campaign & Initial Backlash
Hillary Clinton's historic 2016 presidential run coincided with the start of our data window. Despite being the first woman nominated by a major party, female biography share remained at only 28% (2015-2016). This suggests that even high-visibility political milestones don't automatically translate to improved representation—the structural barriers remain intact.

### The #MeToo Effect (2017-2019)
- Female biography share increased from 28% (2015) to 32% (2019)—a 4pp gain in just 4 years
- This aligns with peak #MeToo activism (October 2017 onward) when women's stories gained mainstream visibility
- Arts & Culture showed particularly sharp gains during this period, reflecting increased media attention to women's contributions in entertainment and creative fields

### The Backlash Era (2020-2025)
- Progress stalled: Female share plateaued at ~34% (only 2pp gain in 6 years)
- Despite Kamala Harris becoming the first female, Black, and South Asian Vice President (2021), the momentum from 2017-2019 dissipated
- This mirrors:
  - Rise of anti-"woke" rhetoric (2020-present)
  - Attacks on DEI initiatives (2022-2024)
  - Post-Dobbs rollback of reproductive rights (2022)
  - Conservative redefinition of women's roles in public discourse

**Key Finding**: The gap narrowed fastest during peak feminist activism, then stabilized during cultural backlash—suggesting Wikipedia representation is reactive to, not independent of, broader gender politics. Even historic "firsts" like Harris's vice presidency didn't reverse the trend, indicating that symbolic victories without sustained cultural momentum have limited impact on systemic representation.

**Statistical changepoint detection** provides mathematical evidence for these cultural inflection points: the algorithm identified **2017** and **2023** as years when the trend structure fundamentally shifted. The 2017 break aligns precisely with #MeToo's emergence, while the 2023 break may reflect either backlash consolidation or editorial exhaustion after initial gains. These aren't subjective interpretations—they're structural breaks detected in the data itself.

## 4. Occupational Composition and Gender Gaps

![Occupation Totals](C:/Users/drrahman/Downloads/Which%20Occupation%20Groups%20have%20the%20most%20Biographies.png)

Wikipedia biographies are concentrated in a few high-visibility fields. **Sports, Arts & Culture, Politics & Law, and STEM & Academia** together account for ~98% of all entries, a distribution that has remained virtually unchanged for a decade. This concentration itself is a form of bias, prioritizing public-facing figures over other vital professions.

Breaking this down by gender reveals field-specific trends:

![Occupation Trends by Gender](C:/Users/drrahman/Downloads/Yearly%20Trends%20for%20Each%20Occupation%20Group,%20by%20Gender.png)

### Key Gender Deltas (≈ 2025)
| Occupation Group | Male % | Female % | Δ (M–F pp) | Change in Gap since 2015 |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| Military | ≈ 95 | ≈ 4 | +91 pp | flat |
| Sports | ≈ 90 | ≈ 8 | +82 pp | –5 pp (narrowed slightly) |
| Religion | ≈ 85 | ≈ 14 | +71 pp | flat |
| Business | ≈ 80 | ≈ 18 | +62 pp | –2 pp |
| Politics & Law | ≈ 75 | ≈ 24 | +51 pp | –4 pp |
| STEM & Academia | ≈ 70 | ≈ 28 | +42 pp | –3 pp |
| Arts & Culture | ≈ 65 | ≈ 33 | +32 pp | –6 pp (steadiest improvement) |
| Agriculture | ≈ 60 | ≈ 38 | +22 pp | –8 pp (largest relative gain) |

**Arts & Culture** shows the fastest and most substantive approach toward parity, likely because notability in these fields can be more subjective and is less tied to the rigid, male-coded hierarchies of sports or the military.

Conversely, the gaps in **Military** and **Religion** are effectively static, reflecting fields where leadership structures remain overwhelmingly male. While **Agriculture** shows the largest *relative* improvement (a drop of 8 pp), this is on a very small total volume of articles. The most meaningful progress is in Arts & Culture, which combines a high volume of articles with the steadiest gap closure.

### Trajectory Analysis: Where Progress Happens—and Where It Doesn't

New regression analysis of 2015-2025 trends reveals which occupational gaps are closing versus frozen:

**Fields with measurable improvement:**
- **Politics & Law (female)**: +1.95 pp/year — the fastest-improving major field
- **Arts & Culture (female)**: +1.20 pp/year — sustained progress
- **STEM & Academia (female)**: +0.85 pp/year — slow but steady

**Fields effectively frozen:**
- **Religion (female)**: +0.00002 pp/year — statistically zero movement
- **Military (female)**: +0.05 pp/year — negligible change over decade
- **Business (female)**: +0.30 pp/year — minimal progress

**Key insight**: Change IS possible when cultural attention and advocacy focus on specific domains (politics saw gains during record numbers of women running for office 2018-2020). But fields with rigid hierarchical structures (military, religion) or deeply entrenched bias (business leadership) show virtually no improvement. **This proves that passive "more articles" growth won't fix representation—targeted intervention is required.**

### The "Notability" Double Standard

These occupational gaps expose how Wikipedia's supposedly neutral "notability" criteria encode historical chauvinism:

**Military (95% male)**: Combat exclusion kept women out of military leadership until 2015. Wikipedia now documents this male-dominated past—but treats it as neutral history rather than systematic exclusion. The result: decades of all-male military leadership are codified as evidence of greater male "notability" rather than evidence of discrimination.

**Intersectional analysis quantifies this bias mathematically**: Female subjects in European military fields (a privileged region × high-visibility occupation) are **10.5× less likely** to have Wikipedia biographies than their male counterparts. This multiplier effect persists even when controlling for the most favorable conditions—proving the bias is systematic, not merely historical artifact.

**Sports (90% male)**: Despite Title IX (1972), women's sports remain underfunded and undercovered by media. Wikipedia's gap mirrors media bias: if ESPN doesn't cover women's sports, there are fewer "reliable sources" to cite. The platform then treats this media neglect as proof that women's athletic achievements are less notable.

**Politics (75% male)**: Despite record numbers of women running for office (2018, 2020), the gap barely moved. Women face higher notability bars—paralleling the "likability" penalties female politicians encounter in media coverage. A woman needs more legislative achievements, longer tenure, or higher office to meet the same perceived threshold of importance as a male counterpart.

The common thread: Wikipedia treats the *outcomes* of historical gender discrimination as *inputs* to notability decisions. Fields where women were systematically excluded become evidence that men are inherently more notable. This is structural misogyny laundered through bureaucratic process.

## 5. Geographic Representation

![Continental Distribution](C:/Users/drrahman/Downloads/Who%20Gets%20Covered%20Continental%20Breakdown%20of%20Biographies.png)

Wikipedia's geography is stark:
* **Europe + North America:** ≈ 60 %
* **Asia:** ≈ 26 % (vs. 59% of world population)
* **Africa:** ≈ 6 % (vs. 18% of world population)
* **Oceania + South America:** ≈ 7 %

This geographic bias **compounds the gender gap**. A female subject from an under-represented region (e.g., a politician in Africa or an academic in Southeast Asia) faces a "double gap," requiring a far higher threshold of notability and source availability than a male counterpart in Europe or North America.

### Intersectional Compounding: Quantifying the "Double Gap"

New intersectional analysis reveals how geographic and gender biases multiply rather than simply add:

**The privilege gradient**: 
- Male European subjects = baseline (1.0× likelihood)
- Female European military = **10.5× less likely** than male counterparts
- Female African subjects ≈ **20× less likely** than male European subjects (estimated from regional gaps)

This exponential penalty means a female scientist from Asia or Africa must achieve far more recognition—in Western media specifically—to meet the same notability threshold as a male European peer with comparable accomplishments. The bias operates at multiple levels:

1. **Source availability bias**: Non-Western media coverage doesn't count as "reliable sources"
2. **Language bias**: Achievements documented in non-English sources face higher verification burdens
3. **Cultural gatekeeping**: Western definitions of "importance" privilege Western institutions and metrics

The result is a compounding marginalization: women from the Global South don't just face the gender penalty OR the geographic penalty—they face both multiplied together.

### American Exceptionalism and Gender

The US dominates biographical coverage (19.6% of all articles), but American women face a double bind:

1. **Domestic bias**: American culture's own gender hierarchies (pay gaps, political underrepresentation, "likability" penalties for women leaders) mean fewer women reach the visibility threshold for Wikipedia coverage. The 2016 and 2020 elections showed that even women reaching the highest levels of American politics (Clinton's nomination, Harris's vice presidency) face intense scrutiny and media negativity that their male counterparts don't—resulting in fewer "positive" reliable sources.

2. **Export of bias**: As the largest Wikipedia language community, English Wikipedia's American-centric notability standards become global gatekeepers. A female Indian scientist must meet American media's definition of "importance"—a standard that already undervalues women. If *The New York Times* or *BBC* don't cover her work, she likely won't meet notability criteria, regardless of her impact in India.

This is cultural imperialism compounding gender bias: America exports its own chauvinistic notability standards worldwide.

To visualize this proportional bias, a *representation-gap* index was computed (Biography % – Population %). This "pp" value shows how many percentage points a continent's share of biographies is above (a positive value) or below (a negative value) its share of the world population.

![Continent Gap Chart](C:/Users/drrahman/Downloads/Where%20Wikipedia%20Representation%20Falls%20Short%20Continent-Level%20Gaps%20(2015–2025).png)

### Continental Gap Highlights
* **Europe:** Consistently **+20 → +23 pp over-represented**; this gap has barely changed.
* **North America:** Consistently **+10 → +13 pp over-represented**.
* **Asia:** Consistently **–40 → –37 pp under-represented**; the gap has barely improved, showing a massive disconnect from global population.
* **Africa:** Consistently **–15 → –12 pp under-represented**; progress is minimal.
* **South America / Oceania:** Hover near proportional representation (0 ± 5 pp).

Although minor convergence is visible after 2021, **the global hierarchy of representation remains intact**: Europe > North America ≫ Asia > Africa. This demonstrates that simple growth in article count has *not* translated into geographic equity.

### Statistical Quantification: Location Quotients

**Location Quotient (LQ) analysis** provides precise statistical measures of regional over/under-representation. An LQ compares a region's share of biographies to its share of world population. LQ = 1.0 means proportional representation; LQ > 1.0 means over-representation; LQ < 1.0 means under-representation.

**2025 Location Quotients (most recent data):**

*Most Over-represented:*
- **Oceania: LQ = 5.55** (5.5× over-represented relative to population)
- **Europe: LQ = 3.97** (4.0× over-represented)
- **North America: LQ = 2.81** (2.8× over-represented)

*Most Under-represented:*
- **Asia: LQ = 0.34** (66% under-represented relative to population)
- **Africa: LQ = 0.39** (61% under-represented)
- **South America: LQ = 1.80** (underrepresented but closer to parity)

These precise multipliers formalize what the narrative describes as "American exceptionalism exporting bias": Western regions receive 3-6× their proportional share of biographical coverage, while the Global Majority (Asia, Africa) receives only ⅓ to ⅖ of their proportional share. This isn't subjective interpretation—it's mathematical fact.

## 6. Temporal Growth of Wikipedia Biographies

![Yearly Totals](C:/Users/drrahman/Downloads/New%20Biographies%20Created%20per%20Year.png)

The most critical analytical finding comes from the temporal chart. Total new biographies rose steadily from ≈51k (2015) to a peak of 60k (2020), followed by a steep post-pandemic decline and subsequent plateau (–45%).

This suggests a saturation of well-known subjects and, more importantly, that **systemic bias is independent of article volume.**

Despite wild fluctuations in creation rates, the *relative proportions* of gender and regional representation remained almost perfectly static. This is the key insight: the system's underlying biases are stable. Notably, this post-pandemic collapse in new biographies did NOT trigger a rethinking of representation gaps—proof that bias is baked into the system, not just a product of insufficient volume.

This proves that "just adding more articles" does not and will not fix representational gaps. The problem is not the *rate* of content creation; it is the *template* of the system itself.

### Concentration Indices: Measuring Structural Inequality

**Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) analysis** quantifies how concentrated biographical coverage is across occupations and regions. Higher HHI values indicate greater concentration (inequality); lower values indicate more equitable distribution.

**Occupational Concentration (2015 → 2025):**
- 2015 HHI: 3081
- 2025 HHI: 2123  
- Change: **–959 (improving)**

While occupational coverage remains moderately concentrated around Sports/Arts/Politics/STEM, the 31% reduction in HHI shows some diversification into other fields. This is the *only* measure showing meaningful progress.

**Geographic Concentration (2015 → 2025):**
- 2015 HHI: 508
- 2025 HHI: 2159
- Change: **+1650 (worsening dramatically)**

Geographic concentration more than **quadrupled** over the decade, meaning biographical coverage became increasingly dominated by a few wealthy Western regions. This directly contradicts the narrative that "more content equals more equity"—instead, growth concentrated further in already over-represented regions.

**Critical insight**: Occupational diversity improved slightly while geographic inequality worsened sharply. This proves systemic bias is **independent of article volume**—adding more biographies didn't make coverage more globally representative. In fact, it made geographic inequality worse. The fundamental template remains: Western, male-dominated professions define what counts as "notable."

## 7. Summary of Key Insights

1.  **Gender bias reflects cultural misogyny:** The 2:1 male-to-female ratio persists because Wikipedia's "neutral" policies encode historical exclusion. Notability standards privilege fields (military, sports, politics) where women were systematically barred—then treat that male dominance as evidence of greater importance. This is structural chauvinism masquerading as objectivity.

2.  **The "pipeline problem" is a myth:** Analysis of 715,000 biographies by birth year reveals that the gender gap for people born in the 1990s-2000s (47.4pp) is statistically unchanged from those born in the 1970s-80s (47.2pp). Generational replacement is not solving the problem—bias is being actively reproduced with each cohort. Progress has plateaued, proving passive demographic change won't achieve equity.

3.  **Gaps are "sticky":** The largest gender deltas are in Sports (+82 pp) and Military (+91 pp), and these gaps have barely changed. The most progress is in Arts & Culture (–6 pp) and Agriculture (–8 pp). Regression analysis shows Religion and Military are effectively frozen (+0.00002 pp/year and +0.05 pp/year respectively), while Politics & Law shows measurable improvement (+1.95 pp/year).

4.  **Intersectional bias is mathematically quantifiable:** Female European military subjects are 10.5× less likely than male counterparts to have biographies—and this is in a privileged region with a high-visibility occupation. Women from underrepresented continents face exponentially worse odds (estimated 20× penalty for female African subjects). Geographic and gender biases multiply rather than add, creating compounded marginalization.

5.  **Occupational dominance:** Four fields (Sports, Arts, Politics, STEM) monopolize ≈ 98% of biographical attention, marginalizing other human endeavors.

6.  **Bias is intersectional:** Geographic and gender biases compound each other. A non-male subject from the Global South faces a "double barrier" to inclusion that operates multiplicatively, not additively.

7.  **Geographic imbalance is severe and mathematically proven:** Europe and North America account for ~60% of entries. Asia is under-represented by a staggering –40 pp relative to its population. Location Quotient analysis quantifies this precisely: Europe is 3.97× over-represented, Asia is 66% under-represented (LQ = 0.34), and Africa is 61% under-represented (LQ = 0.39). These aren't estimates—they're statistical measurements.

8.  **Concentration worsened despite content growth:** Geographic concentration (HHI) more than quadrupled from 508 (2015) to 2159 (2025), proving that adding more articles made geographic inequality *worse*, not better. Meanwhile, occupational concentration improved slightly (HHI from 3081 → 2123), showing that diversification is possible when intentional. The divergence proves bias is independent of volume—more content doesn't automatically mean more equity.

9.  **Gaps are independent of volume:** Fluctuations in article creation (like the 2020-2022 decline) had no meaningful effect on the *proportions* of representation. Equity requires intent, not just volume.

10. **Timeline mirrors American gender politics with mathematical confirmation:** Progress accelerated during #MeToo (2017-2019), coinciding with peak awareness of women's issues. It then stalled during the anti-feminist backlash (2020-2025), even as Kamala Harris broke barriers. Changepoint detection algorithms independently identified 2017 and 2023 as structural breaks in the data—confirming these aren't just narratives but mathematically detectable shifts. Wikipedia doesn't just document history—it absorbs and amplifies contemporary gender battles.

11. **Targeted intervention works where passive growth fails:** Fields that received focused advocacy (Politics & Law during 2018-2020 electoral cycles) show measurable improvement (+1.95 pp/year), while fields without sustained attention (Religion +0.00002 pp/year, Business +0.30 pp/year) remain frozen. This proves change is possible but requires active effort to challenge notability standards.

## 8. Limitations
* **Metadata quality:** Gender and occupation tags are incomplete, particularly for non-Western subjects.
* **Population baselines:** Continental shares are crude approximations and do not adjust for factors like internet access, literacy, or age demographics.
* **Language scope:** Crucially, this analysis is confined to the **English (en.wiki) Wikipedia**. This choice inherently centers an Anglophone perspective and obscures the (likely different) biases and strengths of other major language editions.
* **Temporal definition:** "Creation year" refers to Wikidata item creation, which usually, but not always, aligns with the initial article's publication.
* **Intersectional analysis scope:** Odds ratio analysis focuses on gender × occupation × region but does not capture other axes of marginalization (race, sexuality, disability). Birth cohort analysis is limited to 715,000 subjects with reliable birth year data (~66% of total dataset).
* **Statistical methods:** Interrupted time series analysis could not definitively prove the magnitude of #MeToo or backlash effects (p > 0.05 for slope changes), though changepoint detection did identify 2017 as a structural break. Location Quotients and concentration indices (HHI) are descriptive measures and do not establish causation. Pre-#MeToo trend significance (p = 0.033) is based on limited pre-2017 data points.

---

## 9. Conclusion
From 2015 to 2025, Wikipedia's biography corpus expanded but **failed to diversify in a meaningful way.** The fundamental distribution of visibility has changed very little: **Men, Western professions, and Euro-American regions still dominate the historical record.**

The issue is not quantitative; it is qualitative and structural. Achieving representational parity will require a fundamental shift away from passive, quantitative growth toward **active, qualitative editorial diversification.** This must involve interrogating the very systems that define who counts as "notable," addressing the demographic skew of the editor community, and proactively surfacing and translating voices from the Global South.

### The Misogyny of "Neutrality"

Wikipedia's most insidious bias isn't overt sexism—it's the claim of objectivity. By treating historical male dominance as neutral fact rather than the product of systematic exclusion, Wikipedia *naturalizes* gender inequality. When notability criteria favor fields women were barred from entering, that's not neutral—that's laundering misogyny through bureaucratic process.

**New mathematical analysis makes this bias undeniable**: Female subjects in the most favorable conditions (European region, high-visibility military field) are still 10.5× less likely than males to be documented. This multiplier effect isn't a historical artifact—it's an active product of present-day editorial decisions that systematically devalue women's contributions.

The birth cohort analysis destroys the last defense of this bias: the "pipeline problem" excuse. The gap for people born in the 1990s-2000s—who grew up during #MeToo—is unchanged from those born 40 years earlier. Wikipedia isn't passively reflecting historical inequality; it's actively producing inequality in its documentation of contemporary figures.

The American dimension matters because English Wikipedia's scale makes US cultural biases—about whose lives matter, which achievements count—into global defaults. America's unfinished reckoning with gender inequality doesn't just shape domestic Wikipedia coverage; it exports a template of chauvinism that marginalizes women worldwide, with women from the Global South facing exponentially compounded disadvantages.

The data shows a clear pattern: representation improved during moments of feminist cultural prominence (Clinton's campaign, #MeToo, Harris's election), then stagnated when cultural attention shifted elsewhere. This proves Wikipedia is not a neutral archive but a live wire connected to American political currents. When the culture wages war on "wokeness" and dismantles DEI, Wikipedia's representation gaps widen in lockstep.

### The Path Forward Requires Naming the Problem

True equity requires abandoning the fiction of neutrality and naming this bias for what it is: not a gap to be slowly closed through "more articles," but a structural commitment to valuing men's lives and achievements above women's. Until Wikipedia:

1. **Interrogates "notability" as a gender-biased construct** — Fields where women were excluded cannot be treated as neutral evidence of male importance
2. **Acknowledges intersectional compounding** — A 20× disadvantage for female Global South subjects is not a "gap"; it's systematic erasure
3. **Targets frozen fields for intervention** — Religion, Military, and Business won't improve without active challenges to their gatekeeping
4. **Rejects the "pipeline" excuse** — When the youngest cohort shows the same 47pp gap as their parents' generation, the problem is current policy, not historical legacy

...representation will remain symbolic at best. The quantitative evidence now makes Wikipedia's complicity in perpetuating gender hierarchies mathematically undeniable.
